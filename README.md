This reproducibility package contains the R code to reproduce the figures and examples from the article. The R notebooks for the figures and matching analyses have the format `fig0x.Rmd`. The file `outliers.Rmd` contains code to reproduce the outlier examples presented in sections 2.1 and 3.2. The data needed to use the code are on [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21750614), along with the figures and the knitted notebooks in pdf format (CC-BY license).
